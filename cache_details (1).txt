Level 1 Cache

cache size = 16
block size = 4
associativity = 2
access latency of the cache = 2

Level 2 Cache

cache size = 32
block size = 8
associativity = 2
access latency of the cache = 4

main memory access time = 10

provide access times in cycles and provide sizes in bytes

for fully associative cache type fully
for direct mapped cache put associativity as 1
